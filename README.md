# How to run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run, clone the repository, then run `npm start`. To access the Spotify API, you must either pass a `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` environment variable with your Spotify client ID through the command line, or create a `.env` file in root containing this value (see: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/). This is not secure if publishing a build of the app.
